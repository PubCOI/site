Project initiated November 2020

# Principles

1. All information is to be publicly disclosed, publicly accessible and publicly searchable.
2. An organisation may be a charity, political party, "think tank", trust or otherwise: not just a commercial entity.
3. Benefits include everything from a commission for undertaking a piece of research, through to a cheap promotional pen gifted by an organisational representative.
4. An ‘interest’ includes equity, royalties, patents and otherwise.

# Workstreams

### _Data modelling_

* Define common lexicon / data model: must be flexible enough to be used by journals, conferences etc - models available [here](https://github.com/PubCOI/xml-schemas)

### _Automation_

- Tasked with developing a set of automated tools for pulling in / analysing COI data from major journals

### _Outreach_

Responsibilities are, broadly, twofold:

* Develop relationships with all the professional bodies (ABPI, NMC, GMC, BPS etc) - technical and policy
* Develop relationships with all the leading journals with a view to them adopting a common data model for all COI data

### _Development / infrastructure_

* Tasked with writing a set of services for managing COI data
