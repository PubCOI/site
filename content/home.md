PubCOI is intended to centralise and make publicly accessible all Conflict of Interest (COI) data
for all healthcare professionals based in the UK.

As it stands, only [ABPI](https://www.abpi.org.uk) disclosures are centralised and publicly accessible, via the [Disclosure UK](https://search.disclosureuk.org.uk/) website. Other sources of funding as well as any royalties, equities, patents and benefits in kind are hidden from public view.

This needs to change.
