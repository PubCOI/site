PubCOI is intended to centralise and make accessible all Conflict of Interest (COI) data
for all healthcare professionals based in the UK.

As it stands, only the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry disclosures are centralised and publicly accessible, via their [Disclosure UK](https://search.disclosureuk.org.uk/) website. Other sources of funding as well as any royalties, equities, patents and benefits in kind are hidden from public view.

This needs to change.
