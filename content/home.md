PubCOI is intended to try centralise and make publicly accessible all Conflict of Interest (COI) data
for all Clinical Commissioning Groups, Primary Care Trusts etc based in the UK.

As it stands, only a very small fraction of COI data is easily available. [ABPI](https://www.abpi.org.uk) disclosures are centralised and publicly accessible via the [Disclosure UK](https://search.disclosureuk.org.uk/) website. Other sources of funding as well as any royalties, equities, patents and benefits in kind are hidden in spreadsheets, PDFs, journal appendices and so forth. Indeed in some cases, the data is hidden from public view in its entirely.

This needs to change.
